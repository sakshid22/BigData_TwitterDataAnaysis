record = LOAD '/home/training/Desktop/Final Project/dataset.txt' using PigStorage(',') AS (name:chararray,landmass:int,zone:int,area:int,population:int,language:int,religion:int,bars:int,stripes:int,colours:int,red:int,green:int,

A)Count number of countries based on landmass. DONE

land = foreach record generate $1;
grouping = group land by landmass; 
count = foreach grouping generate group, COUNT(land);
dump count;


B)Find out top 5 country with Sum of bars and strips in a flag. DONE
 alot = order record by bars desc,stripes desc; 


 counter = foreach alot {
  sum1= SUM(record.bars+records.stripes);
  generate sum1;
};
//This one is correct
 summs =foreach record generate name,(bars+stripes) as total;
 top = order summs by total desc; 
 new = limit top 2;

C)Count of countries with icon. DONE
 
 show = filter record by (icon==1);
 groupShow = group show by name;
 ans = foreach groupShow generate group, COUNT(show);

 a= group ans all;
 b = foreach a generate group,COUNT(ans);

D)Count of countries which have same top left and top right color in flag. DONE

 same = filter record by (topLeft==botright);
 get = foreach same generate $0;
 collect = group get by name;
 counts = foreach collect generate group,COUNT(get);
 a = group counts all;
 b = foreach a generate group, COUNT(counts);

 alternate solution:-
 same = filter record by (topLeft==botright);
 get = group same by name;
 ans = foreach get generate group,COUNT(same.name);
 reach = group ans by group.chararray; ||||||||||ERROR PART||||||||
 dump reach;


E)Count no of countries based on zone;  DONE (Curious)
 
 value = group record by zone;
 ans = foreach value generate group,COUNT(record.name); ||||COUNT WORKS but max doesnt||||


// Curious how to calcuate number of countries from ans ??
 a = group ans all;
 b = foreach a generate group,COUNT(ans);


F) Find out largest county in terms of area in NE zone.  DONE

alot = order record by area desc; 
new = filter alot by (zone ==1);
top = LIMIT new 2;  
dump top;

//This code aint working
new = group record by zone;
alot = filter new by MAX(record.area);


G)Find out least populated country in S.America landmass. DONE
alot = order record by population;
new = filter alot by (landmass==2);
top = limit new 1;
dump top;

H) Find out largest speaking language among all countries. DONE

 a = group record by language;
 ans = foreach a generate group,COUNT(record.name) AS totals;
 b = order ans by totals desc;
 c = limit b by 2;


I)Find most common colour among flags from all countries.


J) Sum of all circles present in all country flags.  DONE

  a = filter record by (circles != 0);
  b = group a by name;
  c = foreach b generate group, COUNT(a);
  d = group c all;
  e = foreach d generate group,COUNT(c);

K)Count of countries which have both icon and text in flag. DONE
 
 a= filter record by (icon==1 and text==1);
 b = group a by name;
 c = foreach b generate group, COUNT(a);
 d = group c all;
 e = foreach d generate group,COUNT(c);
